## User Stories
- As a user, I want to see a nice logo for the game, so I would know which game I am currently playing.
- As a user, I want to be able to write my name before starting the game, so I can see it in the results later.
- As a user, I want to be able to choose between playing against AI or against another player, which would give me more options for playing.
- As a user, I want to be able to use both X and O, so it will make the game more exciting.
- As a user, I want to see the X or O shapes when I click on the game grid, so I know the game is working properly.
- As a user, I want to see the results after finishing the game, so I would know who won the game.


## Development Process
- Started by creating the logo of the game.
- Followed by creating 2 game modes as buttons, one for playing against AI and one for playing against another player locally, and players can either input their names, or they can keep the inputs null.
- Then followed by 2 shapes of X and O, which will be chose randomly for players the moment that game mode is selected.
- After that will be the game board which contain the game itself based on the mode and shape chosen earlier.
- Lastly there will be a restart button to clear the board after finishing the game.


## Unsolved Problems
I was planning to show a text applying which player has won the game or even display their names if written, but as it was not able to be done so it is kept to only show a "Winner!" text.


## How to decide the winner
Tic Tac Toe game is a game where 2 sides competing to make a line of 3 shapes on a 3x3 game board. If a player is able to make a line of 3 either in a row, a column, or diagonally, they will be considered as winners.


## Favorite Function
My favorite function was the "changeTurn" function, which was also the hardest to work with. This function will check if it is player1's turn or player2's turn and then switch turns after, and it will also check if player2 is human and will be playing normally on clicks or if it is an AI who will be playing automatically after each of player1's clicks.


## What would you like to add next
I would like to make the AI to be smarter and competitive against the player, instead of playing randomly.
